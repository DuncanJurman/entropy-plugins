# /ralph-claudex:ralph

Main-thread orchestrator for parallel bead execution using ralph-claudex workers and Codex delegation. Do NOT spawn the orchestrator as a subagent.

## Subcommands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/ralph-claudex:ralph` | Show current execution status |
| `/ralph-claudex:ralph start [--parallelism N] [--dry-run] [--filter PATTERN]` | Start orchestrator |
| `/ralph-claudex:ralph <bead-id>` | Run a single bead |
| `/ralph-claudex:ralph stop` | Stop gracefully |
| `/ralph-claudex:ralph resume` | Resume from existing state |
| `/ralph-claudex:ralph health` | Health check |
| `/ralph-claudex:ralph gc` | Clean orphaned worktrees |
| `/ralph-claudex:ralph recover <bead-id>` | Repair a specific bead |
| `/ralph-claudex:ralph unlock [--force]` | Clear stale locks |

## Orchestrator invariants

- Runs in main thread.
- Never edits code in bead worktrees.
- Uses queue files + Task to spawn `god-ralph-worker`.
- Serializes rebase → verify → merge with a merge lock.

## Spawn flow

1. Claim bead: `bd update <bead_id> --status in_progress`
2. Write queue file: `.claude/state/god-ralph/queue/<bead_id>.json`
3. Spawn worker:

### Queue file schema (required)

`ensure-worktree.sh` fails closed if required fields are missing or invalid. The queue file must include `worktree_policy` and `spawn_mode` with valid values.

Required fields:
- `worktree_path` (string; relative or absolute)
- `worktree_policy` (string; one of `required|optional|none`)
- `base_ref` (string; default `main`)
- `spawn_mode` (string; `new|resume|restart|repair`)
- `max_iterations` (number)
- `completion_promise` (string)

Recommended fields:
- `codex.model` (string)
- `codex.model_reasoning_effort` (string)
- `bead_spec` (object; snapshot of bead spec used for this run)

Example:
```json
{
  "worktree_path": ".worktrees/ralph-issue-5oj",
  "worktree_policy": "required",
  "base_ref": "main",
  "spawn_mode": "new",
  "max_iterations": 50,
  "completion_promise": "BEAD COMPLETE",
  "codex": {
    "model": "gpt-5.2-codex",
    "model_reasoning_effort": "high"
  },
  "bead_spec": {
    "bead_id": "issue-5oj",
    "title": "Add settings page",
    "description": "Implement settings page…",
    "ralph_spec": {
      "impact_paths": ["src/settings/**"],
      "acceptance_criteria": [
        { "type": "test", "severity": "required", "command": "npm test" },
        { "type": "ui", "severity": "required", "instructions": "Verify settings save persists after reload." }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

```
Task(
  subagent_type="god-ralph-worker",
  description="God-Ralph worker for <bead-id>",
  prompt="""
BEAD_ID: <bead-id>
WORKTREE_PATH: .worktrees/ralph-<bead-id>
SESSION_FILE: .claude/state/god-ralph/sessions/<bead-id>.json

## Bead Spec
<bd show <bead-id> --json>

## Instructions
Complete this bead. Use Codex MCP to implement changes in the worktree.
Signal completion with: <promise>BEAD COMPLETE</promise>
"""
)
```

## Integration (rebase → verify → merge)

When a session is `worker_complete`:

1. Acquire merge lock (`.claude/state/god-ralph/locks/merge.lock`).
2. Sync main:
   - `git fetch origin main`
   - `git checkout main`
   - `git merge --ff-only origin/main`
3. Rebase bead branch:
   - `git checkout ralph/<bead-id>`
   - `git rebase main`
4. If any UI criteria target Vercel preview, push rebased branch:
   - `git push origin ralph/<bead-id> --force-with-lease`
5. Spawn verifier:

```
Task(
  subagent_type="god-ralph-verifier",
  description="Verify bead <bead-id>",
  prompt="""
BEAD_ID: <bead-id>
WORKTREE_PATH: <absolute worktree path>
SESSION_FILE: <absolute session path>
ARTIFACT_ROOT: <project>/.claude/state/god-ralph/artifacts

Acceptance criteria:
<criteria list>
"""
)
```

6. On verification pass:
   - Mark session `verified_passed`.
   - `git checkout main`
   - `git merge --ff-only ralph/<bead-id>`
   - `git push origin main` (required default).
   - `bd close <bead-id>`.
   - Mark session `merged` and clean worktree.
7. On verification fail:
   - Mark session `verified_failed`.
   - Add bead comment with failure summary + artifact paths.
   - Re-queue with `spawn_mode=resume` (escalate to `restart` after N failures).

## Health check

Run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/ralph-health-check.sh` and surface issues.

## Notes

- Codex autonomy is enforced by plugin hooks: `sandbox=danger-full-access`, `approval-policy=never`, and `cwd` rewritten to the bead worktree.
- UI criteria must produce screenshots under `.claude/state/god-ralph/artifacts/<bead_id>/ui/` when passing.
